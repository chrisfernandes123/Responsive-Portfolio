        <p>
            My name is Chris. I've been in the industry for close to 20 years with global work experience. 
            I am passionate about the synergy between business and technology.  
            <br><br>
            I have expertise in Accounting, Management,
            Information Technology, Supply Chain Management, Six Sigma / Lean Manufacturing, and I can develop solutions in more 
            than 15 programming languages. As challenging as my work seems to get, I truly love working with people to solve problems.
        </p>
      

        <p>
            My main passion is my family.  Work usually consumes the majority of my time, so I thoroughly enjoy
            my down time. I enjoy planning various events and outings for my family and I take full advantage of 
            the few weekends we have as a part of the short Toronto summers.  
            <br><br>
            Advanced scheduling is imperitive when dealing with multiple parties.  Perhaps I will develop a family
            event scheduling web application to help identify availability and interest in various events.  
            <br><br>
            I am really interested in getting to the Javascript section and the database connectivity work. 
            The possibilities seem endless!
